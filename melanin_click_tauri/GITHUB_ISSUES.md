# üêõ GitHub Issues to Create

Please create these issues in the GitHub repository to track the problems we've identified:

## Issue #1: macOS Security Restrictions Prevent Direct App Launch

**Title:** `[Bug] macOS app cannot launch directly due to code signing issues`

**Labels:** `bug`, `macos`, `security`, `high-priority`

**Description:**
```
## Problem
The Melanin Click.app cannot be launched by double-clicking due to macOS Gatekeeper security restrictions.

## Current Behavior
- Double-clicking the app results in no response or security warnings
- Users must use Terminal or override security settings to launch

## Expected Behavior
- App should launch directly when double-clicked
- No security warnings for legitimate users

## Root Cause
- App is adhoc signed, not signed with Apple Developer certificate
- No notarization by Apple
- Gatekeeper blocks unsigned applications

## Workaround
Use Terminal launch:
```bash
export BITCOIN_RPC_PASSWORD="melanin_secure_2025_prod_password"
open "Melanin Click.app"
```

## Solution Needed
1. Obtain Apple Developer certificate
2. Sign the application properly  
3. Notarize with Apple
4. Update build process to handle signing automatically

## Priority
High - Affects user experience significantly
```

## Issue #2: Environment Variable Dependency Breaks User Experience

**Title:** `[UX] App requires environment variable setup before launch`

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `ux`, `configuration`

**Description:**
```
## Problem
The application requires `BITCOIN_RPC_PASSWORD` environment variable to be set before launch, causing crashes if not configured.

## Current Behavior
- App crashes with panic if password not set or less than 16 characters
- Users must manually configure environment each time
- No user-friendly setup process

## Expected Behavior
- App should guide users through initial setup
- Environment should be managed internally
- Graceful handling of missing configuration

## Error Message
```
thread 'main' panicked at src/lib.rs:152:27:
Failed to initialize configuration: Config("BITCOIN_RPC_PASSWORD must be at least 16 characters long")
```

## Solution Needed
1. Create first-run setup wizard
2. Store configuration securely (keychain/credential store)
3. Provide configuration UI within the app
4. Better error handling with user guidance

## Priority
Medium - Affects first-time user experience
```

## Issue #3: Mining Executables Only Available for Windows

**Title:** `[Feature] Add cross-platform mining executable support`

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `mining`, `cross-platform`

**Description:**
```
## Problem
CPU mining functionality only works on Windows due to binary availability limitations.

## Current Behavior
- Windows: ‚úÖ Pre-compiled cpuminer-multi binaries work
- macOS/Linux: ‚ùå Users get error messages, must compile manually

## Expected Behavior
- All platforms should support mining out of the box
- Automatic binary download and setup

## Current Implementation
Points to cpuminer-multi v1.3.1 which only has Windows binaries.

## Solution Options
1. **Pre-compile binaries**: Build cpuminer-multi for all platforms
2. **Alternative miner**: Switch to cpuminer-opt (more actively maintained)
3. **Build automation**: Auto-compile on first run
4. **Hybrid approach**: Binaries where available, compilation fallback

## Recommended Solution
Switch to cpuminer-opt with pre-compiled binaries for all platforms.

## Priority
Medium - Expands platform support significantly
```

## Issue #4: Production Build Resource Bundle Issues

**Title:** `[Build] App bundle has resource validation problems`

**Labels:** `bug`, `build`, `tauri`

**Description:**
```
## Problem
The production app bundle has resource signature issues that may cause launch failures.

## Current Behavior
```
spctl -a -t exec -vv "Melanin Click.app"
# Output: code has no resources but signature indicates they must be present
```

## Expected Behavior
- Clean bundle validation
- Proper resource embedding
- Reliable launch across all systems

## Root Cause
- Tauri bundling configuration may be incomplete
- Frontend resources not properly embedded
- Bundle verification failing

## Solution Needed
1. Review Tauri configuration (tauri.conf.json)
2. Ensure frontend build is properly embedded
3. Fix resource bundling process
4. Test bundle validation on clean systems

## Priority
Low - App works but may have reliability issues
```

## Issue #5: Improve Development Experience

**Title:** `[DX] Streamline development setup and build process`

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `developer-experience`, `documentation`

**Description:**
```
## Problem
Development setup has multiple manual steps and potential failure points.

## Current Issues
- Multiple environment variables to configure
- Platform-specific setup requirements
- Complex build process
- Development vs production configuration differences

## Improvements Needed
1. **Single command setup**: `npm run setup` handles everything
2. **Better error messages**: Guide users through fixes
3. **Development/production parity**: Consistent behavior
4. **Automated testing**: CI/CD pipeline for builds
5. **Hot reload issues**: Better development server integration

## Solution
- Create setup automation scripts
- Improve documentation
- Add development utilities
- Streamline build pipeline

## Priority
Low - Affects developer experience
```
